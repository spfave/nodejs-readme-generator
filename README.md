## **Description**
Node.js README generator is a console application for auto-generating a development application readme file (README.md). A user of the Node.js README generator initiates the program in the console using `node index.js`. The application will then prompt the user through a series of questions to collect information to fill in a README.md file template. 

The application is created with JavaScript and can be run using the Node.js runtime environment. The application makes use of the `inquirer` package for defining the user show prompts and borrowed from the `email-validator` package for creating a email-validation function.
